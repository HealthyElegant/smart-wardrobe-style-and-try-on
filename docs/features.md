Smart Wardrobe: Style & Try-On – Key Features
Smart Wardrobe offers a range of user-friendly features. Here are the key features explained in simple terms:

Digital Closet Organization: Easily create a virtual wardrobe by adding photos of your clothes. The app automatically categorizes each clothing item by type (shirt, pants, dress, etc.), color, and other details, so you can browse your wardrobe on your device anytime. You’ll see your clothing neatly organized with tags (e.g. tops, bottoms, accessories), making it simple to find items. No technical steps needed – just snap a photo and let the AI sort it out for you.

AI Outfit Recommendations: Get personalized outfit ideas tailored to you. The built-in AI stylist looks at the clothes you own and suggests combinations that go well together. Recommendations can adapt to the occasion and weather – for example, you can ask for a casual summer outfit or something suitable for a business meeting on a cold day. The app considers your preferences and context (event, weather, personal style) to offer outfit options, so you don’t have to puzzle over matching items. It’s like getting fashion advice, but from an AI that knows your closet.

Virtual Try-On Previews: See outfits before you wear them. The virtual try-on feature uses augmented reality and image processing to let you visualize how an outfit might look on a person (for example, on a model or even on a photo of yourself). You can mix and match clothes in the app and get a composite image showing the ensemble. This means you can experiment with different clothes and combinations without actually changing clothes, helping you decide if an outfit looks right or if colors/patterns work well together. It’s a quick, fun way to try on outfits virtually and be confident in your choice.

Personal Color Analysis: Discover which colors make you shine. Smart Wardrobe analyzes the colors of your clothing items when you add them (the app can detect dominant colors from the photos). Using this information, it can help coordinate outfits with complementary colors and suggest combinations that look harmonious. Over time, you’ll get to see what colors you wear most and get insights – for example, you might realize you have a lot of blue and not much green. The app can even take into account your color preferences or skin tone insights: if you indicate certain colors you love or avoid, the AI will factor that in so it recommends outfits in shades that flatter you and fit your comfort zone. This feature ensures every outfit not only matches in style but also in color, helping you look cohesive and stylish.

Voice-Controlled Style Assistant: Hands-free styling help. You can interact with Smart Wardrobe using voice commands – simply talk to ask for outfit ideas or style tips, and the AI will answer with a spoken response. For example, you might say, “What should I wear for a wedding this fall?” and hear a suggestion. The app uses a natural-sounding text-to-speech voice to reply, and it understands context (like weather and event) when listening to your questions. If you prefer, you can also type your questions and read the answers; the voice feature is there for convenience. This makes getting fashion advice feel like having a friendly conversation with a stylist, making the experience more interactive and accessible.

(Each of these features works together to provide a seamless experience. You can use as many or as few features as you like – for instance, you might start by just uploading your clothes, and later try the outfit recommendations or voice assistant when you need inspiration.)
